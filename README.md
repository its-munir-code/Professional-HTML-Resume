# Professional-HTML-Resume
A single-page professional resume website built using pure semantic HTML to demonstrate core web structure and formatting without CSS.
My HTML Resume Project 

This is a simple, single-page resume website I built for my web development assignment. The main challenge here was to create a professional-looking layout using pure HTML only—absolutely no CSS allowed!

What’s inside? I focused on using the right HTML tags to make the resume easy to read and well-structured. Here’s a breakdown of what I included:

Header: My name and a quick tagline about being a developer.
About Me: A short intro about my experience.
Skills: A bulleted list of my tech stack.
Experience & Education: I used HTML tables here to keep the dates and roles organized in rows and columns.
Projects: Detailed sections for my work with sub-points for the tech used.
Contact: All my details at the bottom so people can find me.
How to view it Since this is just basic HTML, you don't need to install anything.
